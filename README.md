# Graph_Lattice
SAT models for lattices. The folders SGS, SGS_GAP and Codish contain models for geometric lattices with different approaches for symmetry breaking. There is also an outdated, soon to be redone file explaining the models. New models to be added soon. The branch randoms contains old files for backup. Must have gap, python3 and nauty to run the scripts. 

## To do

1. Finish the script for Codish.
Debug issue with SSG.
