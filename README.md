# Graph_Lattice
Rust code for generating the graph of a lattice and a SAT solution for generating geometric lattices as well as other SAT models.
Contains a draw.sh bash script that generates a picture of the geometric lattice. There is also a script to delete all pictures (.png files within the folder). 
The geometric SAT model is really slow for inputs bigger than 12. The draw.sh script wont accept larger inputs then 12 but this can be changed. 
Essence, minion and python required to run the SAT scripts.
